simplecal
=========

A cal like tool which uses Monday as weekstart, prints weeknumbers and allows to
define custom formats for the output.

The main differences are:

 * Monday as weekstart.
 * Weeknumbers with different ways to calculate them.
 * Deterministic output, the output does not differ depending on the displayed
   month or year, it always looks the same.
 * The formatting of every thing can be specified.
